        My name is Yousof Wakili. I am full-stack software engineer with an
        emphasis on the front-end. I enjoy creating dynamic, responsive, and
        intuitive web applications. When building web applications, I think of
        the end result: the user. My past ventures in the telecom technology
        space wearing many different hats--primarily leading business teams in
        surpassing quotas/goals along with developing their careers. My passion
        for software development stemmed from working in telecom and a personal
        hobby of building computers. When utilizing various Customer Relation
        Management (CRM) tools and prensenting app functionality/features to
        clients, it ultimately led me to take my first programming course: Into
        to Java back in 2016. Fast forward today, I pursued what was a small
        hobby, into my career.
