# Folder Structure & Planning Process

## Below is the folder architecture used during planning stages. Throughout the building process this was updated multiple times to refer back too, most of it being related to config files with Tailwind and Vercel. There was a though process of having simple reusable components (such as the PokeGoldCard, DvlprCard) so that when I complete another project I will be able to easily add and edit my portfolio.
